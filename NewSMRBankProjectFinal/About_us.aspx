<h1>About Us</h1>
<p class="Pera">SMR Bank began operations in 2014 with a simple mission: to be a "World-class Indian Bank".
We realised that only a single-minded focus on product quality and service excellence would help us get there.
Today, we are proud to say that we are well on our way towards that goal.
It is extremely gratifying that our efforts towards providing customer convenience have been appreciated both
nationally and internationally.</p>
